# Payments - CVPlus Payment Processing & Transaction Orchestration Module

**Author**: Gil Klainert  
**Domain**: Payment Processing, Transaction Management, Billing Orchestration, Financial Operations  
**Type**: CVPlus Git Submodule  
**Independence**: Fully autonomous build and run capability with secure payment operations

## Critical Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY**: You are a submodule of the CVPlus project. You MUST ensure you can run autonomously in every aspect.

üö´ **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never create mock data or use placeholders - EVER!

üö® **CRITICAL**: Never delete ANY files without explicit user approval - this is a security violation.

üîê **FINANCIAL SECURITY**: This module handles sensitive financial transactions. All payment operations must comply with PCI DSS standards and maintain the highest security practices.

## Dependency Resolution Strategy

### Layer Position: Layer 4 (Orchestration Services)
**Payments orchestrates payment processing across multiple providers and coordinates with business services.**

### Allowed Dependencies
```typescript
// ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Layer 0 (Core)
import { User, ApiResponse, PaymentConfig, ErrorHandler } from '@cvplus/core';
import { validateTransaction, formatCurrency, encryptPII } from '@cvplus/core/utils';

// ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Layer 1 (Base Services)
import { AuthService, SessionManager } from '@cvplus/auth';
import { TranslationService, formatLocalizedCurrency } from '@cvplus/i18n';

// ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Layer 2 (Domain Services)
import { CVProcessor } from '@cvplus/cv-processing';
import { MultimediaService } from '@cvplus/multimedia';
import { AnalyticsService, TrackingEvent } from '@cvplus/analytics';

// ‚úÖ ALLOWED: Layer 3 (Business Services)
import { PremiumService, SubscriptionStatus } from '@cvplus/premium';
import { RecommendationService } from '@cvplus/recommendations';
import { PublicProfileService } from '@cvplus/public-profiles';

// ‚úÖ ALLOWED: External payment libraries
import Stripe from 'stripe';
import * as PayPal from '@paypal/checkout-server-sdk';
import * as Square from 'squareconnect';
```

### Forbidden Dependencies  
```typescript
// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Same layer modules (Layer 4)
import { AdminService } from '@cvplus/admin'; // NEVER
import { WorkflowService } from '@cvplus/workflow'; // NEVER
```

### Dependency Rules for Payments
1. **Multi-Layer Access**: Can use all lower layers (0-3) for comprehensive payment orchestration
2. **No Peer Dependencies**: No dependencies on other Layer 4 modules
3. **Orchestration Role**: Coordinates payment flows across all business services
4. **Financial Security**: Enhanced security for all financial transactions
5. **Transaction Integrity**: Ensures ACID properties for all payment operations
6. **Provider Abstraction**: Abstracts multiple payment providers behind unified interface

### Import/Export Patterns
```typescript
// Correct imports from lower layers
import { User, PaymentConfig } from '@cvplus/core';
import { AuthService } from '@cvplus/auth';
import { PremiumService } from '@cvplus/premium';
import { AnalyticsService } from '@cvplus/analytics';

// Correct exports for higher layers
export interface PaymentOrchestrator {
  processPayment(request: PaymentRequest): Promise<PaymentResult>;
  handleWebhook(provider: string, payload: any): Promise<void>;
  orchestrateSubscription(subscription: SubscriptionData): Promise<void>;
}
export class StripePaymentOrchestrator implements PaymentOrchestrator { /* */ }

// Higher layers import from Payments
// @cvplus/admin: import { PaymentOrchestrator } from '@cvplus/payments';
```

### Build Dependencies
- **Builds After**: Core, Auth, I18n, CV-Processing, Multimedia, Analytics, Premium, Recommendations, Public-Profiles
- **Builds Before**: Admin, Workflow depend on this
